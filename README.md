# Restaurant Reviews App Stage1
### Project Overview
In this project, a static webpage is converted into mobile ready web application. It lacks display on various devices so I have converted it into mobile-ready application and it is accessible for screen reader.I have added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users. The Cache API is used to cache and deliver the content even when offline.
### How to use the Application
* For live preview click here:  https://meghathedesigner.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/
* For local Download or clone the project and save it in a new folder.
In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.
